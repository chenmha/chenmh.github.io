The 2003 implementation of the first strict seasonal fishing ban along the Yangtze River has successfully preserved fishery resources as originally intended. However, its broader socioeconomic implications remain unknown. Using a difference-in-differences design, we provide the earliest causal evidence of how local biodiversity conservation policies affect scientific research that depends on having abundant and diverse natural resources as research materials. The analysis reveals that the ban spurred higher quality research inquiries about Yangtze River fish. Funded programs have doubled and funding amounts have more than tripled. The scientific output showed more dramatic growth: publications more than tripled, citations increased more than five-fold, and related books, patents, awards, and media coverage all showed significant increases. We demonstrate that the relative increase in biological research materials drives the result, rather than other attention-based or policy-based channels. We conclude that preserving nature is not only an ecological duty but could also be a strategic investment in the future of science and innovation.
